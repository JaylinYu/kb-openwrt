# Learning OpenWrt

## What's OpenWrt

OpenWrt is a highly extensible GNU/Linux distribution for embedded devices (typically wireless routers).
Unlike many other distributions for these routers, OpenWrt is built from the ground up to be a full-featured,
easily modifiable operating system for your router.

Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with
optional package management. This frees you from the restrictions of the application selection and
configuration provided by the vendor and allows you to use packages to customize an embedded device
to suit any application. For developers, OpenWrt provides a framework to build an application without
having to create a complete firmware image and distribution around it. For users, this means the freedom
of full customization, allowing the use of an embedded device in ways the vendor never envisioned.

OpenWrt is not intended to be a distribution you can load onto an embedded device and expect to do
everything you want out of the box. Instead, the OpenWrt framework allows you to tailor your embedded
operating system to your own particular needs. At the very least, you should add features you require
to the bare OpenWrt installation by installing software packages, such as a graphical web interface that
provides easy access for beginners.

OpenWrt's objectives:
- OpenWrt will never be a product, but something which makes it easy to build a product.
- OpenWrt will never be finished, never be complete, but will always be tracking the progress of technology.
- OpenWrt will never be specific, it will always remain generic.
- OpenWrt will never be the cathedral, it will simply supply the building blocks to construct one.
